# Local Storage Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the localStorage functionality implemented across all CosmosAIGraph web application pages to preserve user input state between sessions.

## Overview

Each page now automatically saves user input to browser localStorage and restores it when the page is reloaded. This provides a better user experience by preventing loss of work when navigating between pages or refreshing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. SPARQL Console (`sparql_console.html`)

**Fields with localStorage:**
- `#sparql` (CodeMirror editor) - SPARQL query text
- `#bom_query` (text input) - Entity name and dependency depth

**Storage Keys:**
- `sparql_console_sparql_query`
- `sparql_console_bom_query`

**Features:**
- Auto-save on every change (CodeMirror) and blur/input events
- Restores saved values when page loads
- Works with existing CodeMirror editor integration

### 2. NL2SPARQL Console (`gen_sparql_console.html`)

**Fields with localStorage:**
- `#natural_language` (textarea) - Natural language request

**Storage Keys:**
- `gen_sparql_console_natural_language`

**Features:**
- Auto-save on input and blur events
- Restores saved values when page loads
- Compatible with existing triple-click suggestion feature

### 3. OmniRAG Chat Console (`conv_ai_console.html`)

**Fields with localStorage:**
- `#user_text` (text input) - User chat input

**Storage Keys:**
- `conv_ai_console_user_text`

**Features:**
- Auto-save on blur events
- Restores saved values when page loads and enables submit button if content exists
- Automatically clears saved input when form is successfully submitted
- Compatible with existing triple-click suggestion feature

### 4. Vector Search Console (`vector_search_console.html`)

**Fields with localStorage (already implemented):**
- `#entrypoint` (text input) - Entity name for search
- `#search_limit` (number input) - Result limit
- Search type radio buttons (text/entity)
- Search method radio buttons (fulltext/vector)

**Storage Keys:**
- `vector_search_entrypoint`
- `vector_search_limit`
- `vector_search_type`
- `vector_search_method`

**Features:**
- Already had comprehensive localStorage implementation
- Added to session clearing functionality

## Session Clearing Integration

All localStorage keys are automatically cleared when the user clicks the CosmosAIGraph branding to clear session state. The session clearing functionality in `layout.html` specifically removes:

```javascript
// All localStorage keys for form inputs
localStorage.removeItem('sparql_console_sparql_query');
localStorage.removeItem('sparql_console_bom_query');
localStorage.removeItem('gen_sparql_console_natural_language');
localStorage.removeItem('conv_ai_console_user_text');
localStorage.removeItem('vector_search_entrypoint');
localStorage.removeItem('vector_search_limit');
localStorage.removeItem('vector_search_type');
localStorage.removeItem('vector_search_method');
```

## Error Handling

All implementations include comprehensive error handling:
- Try-catch blocks around localStorage operations
- Console warnings for localStorage errors (e.g., when cookies are disabled)
- Graceful degradation - features work normally even if localStorage fails

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Prevents Data Loss**: User input is preserved across page refreshes and navigation
2. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing features like triple-click suggestions
3. **Auto-Save**: No manual save action required - saves as user types
4. **Smart Clearing**: Automatically clears appropriate fields after successful form submission
5. **Privacy Respecting**: Can be completely cleared via session reset

## Technical Notes

- **Compatibility**: Works with existing CodeMirror editors and form validation
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - only saves on specific events (blur, input, change)
- **Storage Size**: Text-based storage is minimal and well within localStorage limits
- **Cross-page**: Each page has its own storage keys to prevent conflicts

## Usage for Developers

The localStorage functionality is automatically enabled and requires no additional user action. To extend this functionality to new form fields:

1. Choose a unique storage key following the pattern: `{page_name}_{field_name}`
2. Add save/load functions in the page's JavaScript block
3. Set up event listeners for auto-saving
4. Add the storage key to the session clearing function in `layout.html`

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Enter text in any supported form field
2. Refresh the page or navigate away and back
3. Verify the text is restored
4. Click the CosmosAIGraph branding to clear all session data
5. Verify all fields are cleared and start fresh
