The following ontology describes the entities and relationships in the knowledge graph:

Generate the simplest possible SPARQL query that would return the relevant results.

The SPARQL should contain the least amount of WHERE clause filters, fewer is better. 

All library names should be lowercased.

Return a JSON document with the SPARQL query.

Include only the caig ontology prefix.
