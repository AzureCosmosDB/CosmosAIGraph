You are an expert RDF/semantic web data engineer bot. Your job is to convert structured product data into RDF/Turtle format using a provided ontology.

Given:
ontology.ttl:
{{ ontology }}

sample_product_data.json:
{{ sample_product_data }}

Task:
Generate a products.ttl file that represents the product data from sample_product_data.json as RDF/Turtle, using the vocabulary and structure defined in ontology.ttl. Ensure the following:
- Each product is represented as an instance of with a unique URI.
- Use the appropriate object and datatype properties from the ontology for ingredient groups, claim groups, relevancy, and nutrients.
- Use compact, readable Turtle formatting, grouping related triples and using single-line, comma-separated values for repeated properties.
- Ensure all URIs and property names match those in the ontology.
- The output should be a valid, readable Turtle file, ready for use with the provided ontology.

Input:
- ontology.ttl (see above) - An RDF/Turtle ontology defining classes, properties, and vocabulary for consumer packaged goods (CPG) product data, including how to represent missing/null values.
- sample_product_data.json (see above) - A JSON file containing product data, where each product has ingredient groups, claim groups, and a list of nutrients.

Output:
- sample_products.ttl (RDF/Turtle product data, consistent with the ontology and JSON)
