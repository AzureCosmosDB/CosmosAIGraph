You are an expert in knowledge graph and ontology design. I want you to generate an ontology in Turtle (.ttl) format for a CPG product taxonomy and attribute system. The ontology should capture all the elements and relationships described below, starting from:

- Head Claim and up
- Head Ingredient and up
- Head Nutrient and up
- Category and up

**Do NOT include raw data (raw claim, raw ingredient, raw nutrient).**

## Taxonomy Elements and Relationships

### Head Claim
A standardized version of a claim made on a product package.

**Examples:**
- "Free of Milk"
- "Lactose Free Equipment"
- "No Added Sugar"

### Head Claim Group (Claim Base)
A group of similar head claims.

**Examples:**
- "NO_LACTOSE_CLAIM_BASE"
- "NO_ADDED_SUGAR_CLAIM_BASE"
- "NO_GLUTEN_CLAIM_BASE"

### Head Ingredient
A standardized version of a parsed ingredient.

**Examples:**
- "Tomato"
- "Mustard"
- "Sugar"

### Head Ingredient Group (HIG)
A group of similar head ingredients.

**Examples:**
- "MUSTARD_HIG"
- "TOMATO_HIG"
- "SUGAR_HIG"

### Head Nutrient
A standardized nutrient, with the following possible values (can be null/missing):
- per_100g_value
- per_100g_dvp
- per_100ml_value
- per_100ml_dvp
- per_racc_value
- per_racc_dvp
- per_100_calories_value
- per_100_calories_dvp

**Examples:**
- "Added Sugars"
- "Protein"
- "Sodium"

### Category
A standardized grouping of products.

**Examples:**
- "Yogurt"
- "Cheese"
- "Biscuit"

### Relevancy
A group of categories, often for customer or analytical purposes.

**Examples:**
- "target_med_diet_grains"
- "hormone_free_meats_relevancy"
- "gluten_free_bakery_relevancy"

### Attribute
A derived characteristic or property assigned to a product, based on rules using Head Claim Group, Head Ingredient Group, Head Nutrient, Relevancy, or other Attributes.

**Examples:**
- "CONTAINS_ADDED_SUGAR_COMBINATION"
- "HORMONE_FREE_COMBINATION"
- "GLUTEN_FREE_COMBINATION"

**Attribute Rule Example 1:**
```
rule "CONTAINS_ADDED_SUGAR_COMBINATION"
    when
        (has ingredient with HIG CONTAINS_ADDED_SUGAR_ADDITIVE_HIG
         or has attribute CONTAINS_ADDED_SUGAR_CLAIM_BASE
         or has headnutrient Added Sugars with per serve > 0.0)
    and
        has none of these attributes 100_FRUIT_JUICE_CLAIM_BASE, 100_JUICE_BASE, NO_ADDED_SUGAR_CLAIM_BASE
    then
        The product gets attribute CONTAINS_ADDED_SUGAR_COMBINATION
end
```

**Attribute Rule Example 2:**
```
rule "HORMONE_FREE_COMBINATION"
    when
        (contains any of these attributes HORMONE_FREE_CLAIM_BASE, GROWTH_HORMONE_FREE_CLAIM_BASE, SYNTHETIC_HORMONE_FREE_CLAIM_BASE, hormone_free_meats_relevancy
         or does not have attribute HORMONE_ING_HIG)
    and
        does not have attribute CONTAINS_HORMONE_RBST_RBGH_CLAIM_BASE
    then
        The product gets attribute HORMONE_FREE_COMBINATION
end
```

**Attribute Rule Example 3:**
```
rule "GLUTEN_FREE_COMBINATION"
    when
        (has attribute NO_GLUTEN_CLAIM_BASE
         or has ingredient with HIG GLUTEN_FREE_GRAINS_HIG
         or has relevancy gluten_free_bakery_relevancy)
    then
        The product gets attribute GLUTEN_FREE_COMBINATION
end
```

## Classes

- Product has the following fields:
    productId (integer)
- Head Claim has the following fields:
    headClaimId (integer)
    headClaimName (string)
- Head Claim Group has the following fields:
    headClaimGroup (string)
- Head Ingredient has the following fields:
    headIngredientId (integer)
    headIngredientName (string)
- Head Ingredient Group has the following fields:
    headIngredientGroup (string)
- Category has the following fields:
    categoryName (string)
- Relevancy has the following fields:
    relevancyName (string)
- Head Nutrient has the following fields:
    headNutrientId (integer)
    headNutrientName (string)
- Product Nutrient has the following fields (all float or NullValue):
    per100gValue
    per100gDvp
    per100mlValue
    per100mlDvp
    perRaccValue
    perRaccDvp
    per100CaloriesValue
    per100CaloriesDvp

## Relationships

- Product has Head Claims (many-to-many)
- Head Claim belongs to Head Claim Groups (many-to-many)
- Product has Head Ingredients (many-to-many)
- Head Ingredient belongs to Head Ingredient Groups (many-to-many)
- Product has Head Nutrients (many-to-many)
- Product belongs to Category (many-to-one)
- Category belongs to Relevancies (many-to-many)
- Product has Attributes (many-to-many)
- Attribute can be defined based on Head Claim Group, Head Ingredient Group, Head Nutrient, Relevancy, or other Attributes

## Instructions

- Define all classes, properties, and relationships needed to represent the above taxonomy and relationships.
- Use clear, descriptive names for classes and properties.
- Include at least three example individuals for each class where examples are provided.
- Ensure the ontology is suitable for building a knowledge graph that can answer complex queries about products, their claims, ingredients, nutrients, categories, relevancies, and attributes.
- Create a class ProductNutrient which has all the product related nutrient values. A product links to the ProductNutrient which then links to HeadNutrient.
- Define a single individual of the :NullValue class. In example individuals, when a nutrient value is missing/null, use :NullValue as the value for that property (e.g., :per100mlDvp :NullValue). Ensure all nutrient value properties are defined as owl:ObjectProperty with a range that allows both xsd:float and :NullValue.

**Output only the ontology in Turtle (.ttl) format.**
